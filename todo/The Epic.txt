		Need help with anything: a man was found on one of our patrols unconscious, when he awoke he told us that he had escaped
		the black knights jails in the taverley dungeon. The man said that he overheard the black knights discussing a new
		plot. they plan on poisoning the water supply of the nearby towns. If what this escapee says is true, then many
		could die. if you want to help, you have to find some proof of what this man says.
