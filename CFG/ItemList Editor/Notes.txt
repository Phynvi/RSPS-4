ItemList Editor is a tool developed by Bloodraider[PSNB].
---------------------------------------------------------

Information
------------
This tool was designed as an effective, yet easy to use tool to
configure values of items. It was originally developed as part
of a development-toolkit, but seeing as I've received very few
suggestions for tools, I decided to release this tool stand-alone.
Best of luck

Instructions
------------
Click on the Load List button, and navigate to your Item configuration
file [item.cfg]. After selecting the file, the tool will load each item
name into the program. Note: You're going to have to use the item.cfg
provided in the download as there seems to be a bug that messes this up
in others. I'm not sure how to fix, as I've noticed it varies from cfg
to cfg.

Search for the item name, or ID of the item you wish to edit. Alternatively
you can scroll through the list to locate the item you're looking for.

Double click on the item you wish to edit, and it's information will be loaded
into the editing fields.

Change the values of the fields to whatever you desired, then click on the 'save edited item'
button.

After you've made your changes, press save list, and select an output directory.
